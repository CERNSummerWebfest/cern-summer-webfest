				<h3>Big Bottom</h3>
				The bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin
				That's what I said.
				The looser the waistband, the deeper the quicksand
				Or so I have read.
				My baby fits me like a flesh tuxedo.
				I love to sink her with my pink torpedo.
				Big bottom
				Big bottom
				Talk about bum cakes,
				My gal's got 'em.
				Big bottom,
				Drive me out of my mind.
				How can I leave this behind?
				I saw her on monday, twas my lucky bun day
				You know what I mean.
				I love her each weekday, each velvety cheekday
				You know what I mean.
				My love gun's loaded and she's in my sights
				Big game's waiting there inside her tights
				Big bottom
				Big bottom
				Talk about mud flaps
				My gal's got 'em.
				Big bottom
				Drive me out of my mind.
				How can I leave this behind?
				<h3>Stonehenge</h3>
				In ancient times hundreds of years before the dawn of history
				Lived this strange rights of pain the [Incomprehensible]
				No one knows who they were what they were doing
				But the legacy remains here into the living rock of Stonehenge

				Stonehenge, where the demons dwell
				Where the banshees live and they do live well
				Stonehenge where a man is a man
				And the children dance to the pipes of pan

				Stonehenge, 'tis a magic place
				Where the moon doth rise with a dragon's face
				Stonehenge where the virgins lie
				And the prayer of devils fill the midnight sky

				And you my love, won't you take my hand?
				We'll go back in time to that mystic land
				Where the dew drops cry and the cats meow
				I will take you there, I will show you how

				And oh, how they danced
				The little children of Stonehenge
				Beneath the haunted moon for fear
				That day break might come too soon

				And where were they now
				The little people of Stonehenge
				And what would they say to us
				If we were here tonight
				<h3>Tonight I'm gonna rock you</h3>
				Little girl, it's a great big world but there's
				only on of me
				You can't touch 'cause I cost too much but
				Tonight I'm gonna rock you
				Tonight I'm gonna rock you
				Tonight!
				You're sweet but you're just four feet
				And you still got your baby teeth
				You're too young and I'm too well hung
				Tonight I'm gonna rock you
				Tonight I'm gonna rock you
				Tonight!
				You're hot, you take all we got, not a dry
				seat in the house
				Next day, we'll be on our way
				Tonight I'm gonna rock you
				Tonight!
				Chorus:
				Little girl, it's a great big world, but there's
				only one of me-
