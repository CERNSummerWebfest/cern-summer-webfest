<h1>The Higgs</h1>


<p class="abstract">On July 4th 2012, the two LHC experiments ATLAS
and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which is likely to be
the Higgs boson. It has been the missing piece of the Standard Model
for many years, and its discovery is one of the most amazing successes
of physics. In this chapter, we will explain the Higgs mechanism, that
gives mass to all the particles we know by now.</p>
