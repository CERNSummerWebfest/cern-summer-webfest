<p class="abstract">There must be some kind of force that glues together the quarks in the
proton, just like the electromagnetic force attaches the electron to
the atomic nucleus. And like for electromagnetism, there must be
messenger particle of this force, and also a kind of “charge”, called
golor, that will determine which particles take part in this
interaction and whether two particles will attract or repel each
other. This force is very different from electromagnetism: no particle
that has a color can exist freely, they must be in a bound system. The
messenger particles of this interaction are called gluons, and they
themselves carry color, so they cannot exist freely either.</p>


<p class="abstract">Looking at the proton, we see that there are three
quarks glued together - unlike in the hydrogen atom, where there are
only two partners: the proton and the electron.  Hence, something must
be different about this strong, nuclear force, that glues together the
quarks. There are three different kinds of "charge", as opposed to
electromagnetism, where there are only two, which we call positive and
negative. For the strong force, the "charge" is called color.</p>
