Strong interactions
There must be some kind of force that glues together the quarks in the proton, just like the
electromagnetic force attaches the electron to the atomic nucleus. And like for electromagnetism,
there must be messenger particle of this force, and also a kind of “charge”, called color, that will
determine which particles take part in this interaction and whether two particles will attract or
repel each other. This force is very different from electromagnetism: no particle that has a color
can exist freely, they must be in a bound system. The messenger particles of this interaction are
called gluons, and they themselves carry color, so they cannot exist freely either.
