<h1>The  Weak Interaction</h1>

<p>Some nuclear decays cannot be explained with only the strong and
the electromagnetic interactions, another interaction is
required. These decays are called beta decays (Î²-decay), and turn a
neutron into a proton (or the other way around) and emit an electron
and a new particle, the neutrino [or a positron (an
antielectron)]. They are rare and very different from the other types
of decays, which is the reason that we need the new force to explain
them, the weak force. This force has the Z and W bosons as messenger
particles, these differ from the other messenger particles in that
they have a mass, they are in fact very massive.</p>
