<h1>The Electromagnetic Interaction</h1>

<p class="abstract">The electromagnetic force is the force affecting
electrically charged particles. This is the force that keeps the
electrons close to the nucleus of an atom. How do the charged
particles communicate with each other? They exchange a certain type of
particle, called the photon. This is the same particle that makes up
light! Visible light, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are all
photons, with different energies.</p>
