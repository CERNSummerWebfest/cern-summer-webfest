<p>Antimatter sounds like an exotic and mysterious substance that
could destroy the world in no time at all. In fact, it is the same as
everything else, just with a different charge[ref]. Antiparticles have
all the same properties[ref] as particles, with the same mass and the
same stability, and so are not more than everyday matter. Every
particle has a corresponding antiparticle, with all of the same
properties, except with an opposite charge. So an electron[ref] which
is positively charged[ref], will have a negatively charged[ref]
antiparticle called a positron.</p>

<p>The problem comes when matter and antimatter come together. Because
there is a lot of matter in our universe, antimatter is quite likely
to bump into its corresponding matter partner. When an equivalent
matter and antimatter pair collide they annihilate, which means that
they disappear, releasing a huge amount of energy. Antiparticles can
only annihilate with their particle pair, so a antiproton will not
annihilate with an electron. However, because there are lots of
protons around in our universe, it is likely that the antiproton will
quickly find one to annihilate with.</p>


<h2>Don't Knows</h2>
<p>There is a lot that we still don’t know for certain about
antiparticles. We do not know why there are so many particles and not
many antiparticles. It is obvious that antiparticles will annihilate
quickly which explains why there is not much antimatter left in our
universe, but if all antimatter has been annihilated by matter, then
there should be no matter left at all. As it is, we have lots of
matter, so there must have been a lot more matter created at the time
of the big bang than antimatter. We are currently trying to work out
why that is.</p>


<p>We create antiparticles in exactly the same quantity as particles
when we collide particles. When the particles hit a target at a very
high energy, many different particles will come out. Particles will be
produced in pairs, with each particle also having their
antiparticle. </p>

<h2> Outlook</h2>

<p> We’re almost done. You were probabily already waiting for the
last chapter, the one on the Higgs boson. Here it comes!</p>
